### üöÄ Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally using Docker.

#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Docker Compose** (for orchestrating services)

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ICSI518/assignment2-HeatFlake911.git
cd assignment2-HeatFlake911
```

#### 2. Run the Application with Docker
To run the project using Docker, simply execute the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:

- Build the backend and frontend Docker containers.
- Start a MongoDB container.
- Set up **Caddy** as the reverse proxy to handle requests.
- Launch the application with the configured services, including **PM2** for managing the backend server.

#### 3. Accessing the Application
Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application by visiting the following URL in your browser:

```bash
http://localhost:1000
```

This will load the **React** frontend, and all backend API requests will be routed to the **Express** server through **Caddy**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Vite**: Build tool for faster development and production build.
  - **React Router**: For navigation between pages.
  - **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
  - **React Toastify**: For showing toast notifications.

- **Backend**:
  - **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle API routes and logic.
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication and session management.
  - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
  - **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
  - **PM2**: Process manager for Node.js, used to keep the backend application running in production.

- **Containerization**:
  - **Docker**: Tool to create, deploy, and run applications in containers.
  - **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
  
- **Authentication**:
  - **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure authentication and managing user sessions.

- **State Management**:
  - **Context API**: For managing global state (e.g., user authentication, cart data).

- **Reverse Proxy**:
  - **Caddy**: Web server and reverse proxy used for serving the application over HTTPS.

---

### üí° Additional Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login and session management using JWT tokens.
- **User Profile Management**: Allows users to view and edit their profile after logging in.
- **Cart and Wishlist Management**: Users can add, remove, and view products in their cart and wishlist.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Both frontend and backend services run in isolated Docker containers.
- **MongoDB Initialization**: Predefined products are inserted into the database on container startup using an initialization script.
- **Caddy as Reverse Proxy**: Handles HTTPS setup and reverse proxies the traffic to backend services.
- **PM2 for Process Management**: Ensures the backend server runs in production without crashes.

---

### üíª Local Development Workflow
To start working on the project, you can use the following workflow:

1. **Make Changes Locally**: 
   - Work on the React frontend components in the `client` directory.
   - Implement API logic and routes in the `server` directory.
  
2. **Rebuild Containers**: 
   - After making changes to the code, rebuild the Docker containers by running:
   
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Test the Application Locally**: 
   - Open `http://localhost:1000` in your browser to test your changes.

---

### üåê Deployment on AWS EC2 (Optional)
To deploy this application on an **AWS EC2** instance, follow these steps:

1. **Launch EC2 Instance**: 
   - Log into AWS, create an EC2 instance (Ubuntu recommended), and note the public IP.
  
2. **SSH into EC2**:
   - SSH into your EC2 instance using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository on your EC2 instance:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ICSI518/assignment2-HeatFlake911.git
   cd assignment2-HeatFlake911
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Run the Docker containers on EC2:
   
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **Access the Application on EC2**:
   - Access the application using the public IP of your EC2 instance:
   
   ```bash
   http://http://18.119.29.153:1000
   ```

   ```bash
   http://ec2-18-119-29-153.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:1000
   ```

---

### üîÑ Caddy for Reverse Proxy Setup 
Since **Caddy** is already included in the Docker setup, it will handle reverse proxy and SSL automatically, as defined in the **Dockerfile**.

- **Caddy Configuration** is handled within the **Dockerfile** and **Caddyfile**.
- No need for manual installation or setup of **Caddy** on the server, as it is configured to automatically handle requests over HTTPS and route them to the backend.
